Instructions for the program are provided in asg1-dc-bigint.pdf.

=================================================================
My implementation of the code is in:

	Bigint.cpp
	ubigint.cpp
	
All other code was provided by instruction Wesley Mackey at UCSC
=================================================================

/Tests/mk.tests is a script which will test functionality of the program

Each test consists of a:
	ydc file - input for the program to execute
	err file - output of any errors that occur during test
	out file - output for the program
	status file - error code if program fails (0 on success)
